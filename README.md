For using Visual Code you would:
  1. Head over to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and download it to your device.
  2. Before doing any other add ons, I recommend to create a folder or folders for what is VS Code would be used for.
  3. You would then go over to the extensions tab and download any coding languages you will be using.
