hi

Part 1: 
For using Visual Code you would:
  1. Head over to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and download it to your device.
  2. Before doing any other add ons, I recommend to create a folder or folders for what is VS Code would be used for.
  3. You would then go over to the extensions tab and download any coding languages you will be using. 

Part 2:
  <strong>Branch:</strong> making branches allow you to make changes to your project without effecting your final project.
  <strong>Clone:</strong> repeats all copies of files and folders of your project.
  <strong>Commit:</strong> committing finalizes any changes that were made to the file or files on your branch.
  <strong>Fetch:</strong> is used to grab updated work from other people without merging them onto your own branch
  <strong>GIT:</strong> a control system that lets developers get their repository with full commit history
  <strong>GitHub:</strong> a website to work on and collab projects (any languages)
  <strong>Merge:</strong> lets you take independent lines and put them into a single branch
  <strong>Merge Conflict:</strong> happens when you merge branches that have competing commits.
  <strong>Push:</strong> updating the repository/branch with the latest code 
  <strong>Pull:</strong> getting the latest code that was written to your repository
  <strong>Remote:</strong> the place where the code is stored
  <strong>Repository:</strong> a place to store your projects
